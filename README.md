# 2024 College Basketball Analysis  

This project provides an interactive analysis of the **2024 NCAA College Basketball season**, focusing on team performance, predictive modeling, and data-driven insights. Built using **R Markdown** and rendered as a **flexdashboard**, the project highlights both descriptive statistics and visualizations.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Exploration**: Summarizes win/loss records, scoring averages, and efficiency metrics across teams.  
- **Modeling & Predictions**: Applies regression and classification methods to evaluate team performance and identify potential tournament outcomes.  
- **Interactive Visuals**: Uses R packages like `ggplot2` and `flexdashboard` to deliver dynamic charts and tables.  
- **Reproducibility**: Analysis is written in R Markdown (`Project1.Rmd`) and compiled into an HTML report (`Project1.html`).  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **R** (statistical computing)  
- **R Markdown** (reporting and documentation)  
- **Flexdashboard** (interactive visualization framework)  
- **ggplot2, dplyr** (data wrangling and visualization)  

## How to Use  
1. Open `Project1.Rmd` in RStudio to view or modify the source code.  
2. Knit the file to generate the interactive `Project1.html` dashboard.  
3. Explore the interactive plots and tables in your browser.
